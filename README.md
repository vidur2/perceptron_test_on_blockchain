# perception_test_on_blockchain
A single smart contract which behaves as a perceptron can be trained and used on the blockchain. 

## Requirements
In order to test/compile the code you need to have Rust installed. You can see the installation process (https://rust-lang.org). 

### Testing
To test the perceptron accuracy run cargo test on your computer.

## Deployment
The wasm file can be deployed to the near blockchain.
An Example of a transaction can be seen here: https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/APh4tgD2VpDV4h4RrxKbMNYycDjrp9jP8FzbvH5iySwp
